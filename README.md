# quickSort2.py doesn't mean QuickSort version 2.0
About the name: I thought about what if I make a QuickSort function just by reading its theory. Then I made quickSort.py and stated. Well, it's harder than I thought, I did take a look at some example codes, but I wouldn't go for copying because I care about my future. After a few hours, it didn't work. On the next day, after thinking about the theory in another way, it worked and I've not found and special case that would mess up it. 

P/S : I'm so sorry if my English is bad
P/S2 : This is also the repo I use to practise `git`
