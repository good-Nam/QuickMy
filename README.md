# quickSort2.py doesn't mean QuickSort version 2.0
About the name: I thought about what if I made a QuickSort function just by reading its theory. Then I made quickSort.py and stated. Well, it's harder than I thought, I did take a look at some example codes, but I wouldn't go for copying because I wanted to test my problem-solving skills. After a few hours, it didn't work. On the next day, after thinking about the theory in another way, it worked. 

P/S : I'm so sorry if my English is bad

P/S2 : This is also the repo I use to practise `git`
